-- Move the analysis to the plugin system. This is a major rewrite of the
-- database backend that supports the analysis pipeline.
-- After exploring the data on the database, we realized that
-- there are a lot of inconsistencies in the data. Unfortunately, this
-- makes the process of transferring the data from the old structure
-- to the new one a bit more challenging, as we will need to handle
-- different special cases. Furthermore, all the information needed is not
-- present in the database, since it requires checking BIOM files. Due to these
-- reason, the vast majority of the data transfer is done in the python patch
-- 51.py

-- In this file we are just creating the new data structures. The old
-- datastructure will be dropped in the python patch once all data has been
-- transferred.

-- Create the new data structures

-- checked) that are not attached to any analysis. Not sure how this
-- can happen, but these orphan jobs can't be accessed from anywhere
-- in the interface. Remove them from the system. Note that we are
-- unlinking the files but we are not removing them from the filepath

-- not used anywhere else
