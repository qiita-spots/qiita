# --------------------- External Identity Provider settings --------------------
# user authentication happens per default within Qiita, i.e. when a user logs in,
# the stored password hash and email address is compared against what a user
# just provided. You might however, use an external identity provider (IdP) to 
# authenticate the user like 
#    google: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2 or
#    github: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps or
#    self hosted keycloak: https://www.keycloak.org/
# Thus, you don't have to deal with user verification, reset passwords, ...
# Authorization (i.e. if the authorized user is allowed to use Qiita or which
# user level he/she gets assigned is an independent process. You can even use
# multiple independent external identity providers!
# Qiita currently only support the "open ID connect" protocol with the implicit flow.
# Each identity provider comes as its own config section [oidc_foo] and needs
# to specify the following five fields:
#
# Typical identity provider manage multiple "realms" and specific "clients" per realm
# You need to contact your IdP and register Qiita as a new "client". The IdP will
# provide you with the correct values.
#
# The authorization protocol requires three steps to obtain user information:
# 1) you identify as the correct client and ask the IdP for a request code
#    You have to forward the user to the login page of your IdP. To let the IdP
#    know how to come back to Qiita, you need to provide a redirect URL
# 2) you exchange the code for a user token
# 3) you obtain information about the user for the obtaines user token
# Typically, each step is implemented as a separate URL endpoint
#
# To activate IdP: comment out the following config section

#[oidc_academicid]
#
## client ID for Qiita as registered at your Identity Provider of choice
#CLIENT_ID = gi-qiita-prod
#
## client secret to verify Qiita as the correct client. Not all IdPs require
## a client secret!
#CLIENT_SECRET = 5M6zKl8SKrlnRP4tPgtrgZpCpcYCj7uK
#
## redirect URL (end point in your Qiita instance), to which the IdP redirects 
## after user types in his/her credentials. If you don't want to change code in 
## qiita_pet/webserver.py the URL must follow the pattern:
## base_URL/auth/login_OIDC/foo where foo is the name of this config section 
## without the oidc_ prefix!
#REDIRECT_ENDPOINT = /auth/login_OIDC/localkeycloak
#
## URL for step 1: obtain code
#AUTHORIZE_URL = https://keycloak.sso.gwdg.de/auth/realms/academiccloud/protocol/openid-connect/auth
#
## URL for step 2: obtain user token
#ACCESS_TOKEN_URL = https://keycloak.sso.gwdg.de/auth/realms/academiccloud/protocol/openid-connect/token
#
## URL for step 3: obtain user infos
#USERINFO_URL = https://keycloak.sso.gwdg.de/auth/realms/academiccloud/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
#
## a speaking label for the Identity Provider. Section name is used if empty.
