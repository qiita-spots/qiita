Qiita (canonically pronounced *cheetah*) is a meta-analysis environment for microbiome (and other "comparative -omics") datasets. You can find the public Qiita server at [qiita.microbio.me](qiita.microbio.me).

Qiita is currently in pre-alpha status. We are very open to community contributions and feedback.
