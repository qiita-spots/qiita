Qiita Philosophy
================

Plugin ideology
---------------

Qiita can be seen as an analytical pipeline broker that can apply any specific
pipeline, tool, or script to any of its stored data. All the analytical
pipelines are autonomous and independently developed, and tested, which
facilitates the support of current tools and the development of new ones. This
principle is supported via virtual environments and artifacts. Virtual
environments for each pipeline gives the freedom of adding any pipeline with
any software dependencies to Qiita. Artifacts, basically any file in the
system, from raw sequence to contingency tables or even data visualizations,
permits the system to store any kind of data but also define within each
pipelines which commands and parameters can applied to them.

The current plugins available are:

* Target gene processing via `QIIME <http://qiime.org>`__: sequence
  demultiplexing, and QC of SFF, fasta/qual, fastq and per sample fastq.
  Closed reference OTU picking.

A Study
-------

Qiita’s main entity is the idea of Study. A study can have many samples, with
many preparations, that have been sequenced several times, Figure 1.
Additionally, study artifacts have 3 different states: sandboxed, private and
public. A sandboxed artifact has all operational capabilities in the system
but is not publicly available, allowing for quick integration with other
studies but at the same time keeping it private so the user can improve the
analysis. Once a user decides that is time to make their artifact public they
can request an administrator to validate their study information and make it
private and possibly submit to a permanent repository, where it can also be
kept private until the user wants to make it public. At this stage in Qiita
the whole study (including all processed data) is private. This process is
completely automatic via the GUI. Currently sequence data is being deposited
for permanent storage to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), part of the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). Finally, when the user is ready,
usually when the main manuscript of the study is ready for publication, the
user can request for the artifact to become public, both in Qiita and the
permanent repository, Figure 2.

   **Figure 1. Qiita’s main structure: from single to multiple studies.** More
   and more a simple study is composed by a multiple samples which have been
   prepared chemically to identify diverse microbial composition parts of them.
   For example, 16S to see which kind of bacteria lives on them, Metabolomics
   to see the substance formed by the community, and/or ITS for the fungi.
   Additionally, Qiita allows users to compare their studies with other public
   ones already available in the system.

   **Figure 2. Possible Qiita artifact states.** Artifacts are any file,
   either uploaded by users or generated by the system. There are 3 possible
   states: sanboxed, private and public. In the sandboxed and private states
   no other user has access to the artifacts, except if the owner invites a
   guest. In the public state, the artifact is open to all users in the
   system, and the study can be searched from the study listing page.


Portals
-------

Qiita allows to host multiple portals within the same infrastructure. This
allows each portal to have a subset of studies in a different URL but sharing
the same resources. Sharing the same backend resources avoids having multiple
sites and data getting out of sync.

The current available portals are:

* Main site (all studies from all portals): qiita.microbio.me
* Sloan portal (build environment): sloan_microbe.microbio.me
* Earth Microbiome Project portal (studies generated under the
  `EMP <http://www.earthmicrobiome.org>`__): emp.microbio.me
