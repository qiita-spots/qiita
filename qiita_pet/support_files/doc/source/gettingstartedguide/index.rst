.. _prepare-information-files:

Creating and Working With Sample information
--------------------------------------------

*  The :doc:`../qiimp` tab located at the top of the page is a useful tool for creating Qiita and EBI compatible metadata spreadsheets.

Example files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download an example sample information file from
`here <ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/qiita/sample_prep_information_files_examples.tgz>`__.

EBI-ENA NULL values vocabulary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all public studies including those being submitted to EBI, no blanks are allowed in the sample information.
We support the following null values: *not applicable*, *not collected*, *not provided*,
*restricted access*.

For the latest definitions and explanation visit the `EBI/ENA Missing value reporting <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/missing-values-reporting>`__.

.. warning::
   Column names in your information files cannot be named as a Postgres reserved word. For example, a column cannot be named
   `CONDITION`, but could instead be named `DISEASE_CONDITION`. For a full list of these reserved words, see this
   `link <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-keywords-appendix.html>`__.


Sample information file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *sample information file* will define the biological context of each
sample, with categories like ``sample_type``, ``treatment``,
etc. The ``sample_name`` defined in this file is used to relate each
sample in the preparation file with the biological sample.

Required fields for Qiita
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that Qiita require to have at least two columns, including ``sample_name``, for a
sample information file to be added to the system:

+-------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field name        | Format                      | Description                                                                   |
+===================+=============================+===============================================================================+
| ``sample_name``   | free text with restrictions | Identifies a sample. It is the primary key and must be unique. Allowed        |
|                   |                             | characters are alphabetic ``[A-Za-z]``, numeric ``[0-9]``, and periods ``.``. |
+-------------------+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Required fields for EBI submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to submit your data to EBI, certain fields are required in your sample information file. You can download a spread sheet containing these required fields on the `Knight Lab website <https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/wordpress/?page_id=478>`__ under "MetaData Template".

  * Your past metadata file cannot be deleted but fields can be deleted

    * To remove data, go to the Sample Information tab on the Sample Information page and use the trash icon to delete the unwanted fields

  * You can update the fields that do exist (these fields can be found on the sample information tab on the sample information page)

    * Upload a new sample info file including only the updated field data and the sample_name field

  * You can add new fields

    * Upload a new sample info file including only the field data you want to add and the sample_name field

  * Sample names cannot be deleted

    * Any sample name change will be interpreted as a new sample

  * *Note that these changes will not update on your analysis but these changes will not affect your processing data since the metadata isn’t applied until analysis*

Creating and Working With Preparation information
-------------------------------------------------

.. _prepare_information_files:

Prepare information files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The set of required fields for the *sample information* and *preparation
information files* varies based on the functionality that you want to
use from the system.

As described in :doc:`../qiita-philosophy/index`, a Qiita study can have
many biological samples, each with many preparations for different kinds of
multi-omic analysis. Thus, the study will have a single *sample information
file* that will define the biological context of each sample. Each multi-omic
data type prepared will have a separate *preparation information file* that
will describe the sequencing technology or analytical chemistry used to
generate that data set.

To increase the chance of successful meta-analyses we suggest following the
`Earth Microbiome Protocols and Standards <http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/>`__.

Please note that while *sample information* and *preparation information files*
are similar to a `QIIME metadata file
<http://qiime.org/documentation/file_formats.html#metadata-mapping-files>`__,
they are conceptually different. A QIIME metadata file includes information
about the biological context, like ``sample_type``, and about the wet lab
processing, like ``BarcodeSequence``. Qiita intentionally separates this
information into two separate files; it would be conceptually incorrect
to include ``BarcodeSequence`` (barcode) with the *sample information*, as this
information pertains to the wet lab preparation and should be placed in the
*preparation information file*.

Ensure that your prep information column names are correct.

Example files

`here <ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/qiita/sample_prep_information_files_examples.tgz>`__

Required fields for Qiita
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that Qiita require to have at least two columns, including ``sample_name``, for a
prep information file to be added to the system:

+===================+===============================+========================================================================+
| ``sample_name``   | free text with restrictions   | Identifies a sample. It is the primary key, must be unique and should  |

Required fields for pre-processing target gene data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are adding target gene data (e.g. 16S, 18S, ITS), there are
additional columns that are required for successfully preprocessing
them:

+---------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field name    | Format             | Description                                                                           |
+===============+====================+=======================================================================================+
| ``primer``    | IUPAC characters   | The primer sequence (this is usually the forward primer for Illumina processed data,  |
|               |                    | or the barcoded primer for LS454 data;                                                |
|               |                    | `examples <http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v6/n8/extref/ismej20128x2.txt>`__).    |
+---------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``barcode``   | IUPAC characters   | The barcode sequence                                                                  |

+---------------+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In case that your data has been sequenced using multiple sequencing lanes or you
have :ref:`per_sample_fastq_files_without_barcode_or_primer_information`, an
additional column is required.

+------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field name       | Format      | Description                                                                                |

|                  |             | and ``my-data.fastq`` becomes ``my-data``).                                                |
