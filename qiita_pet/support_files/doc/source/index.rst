Welcome to Qiita's documentation!
=================================

Qiita (canonically pronounced cheetah) is a software package intended for
analysis and administration of multi-omics datasets.

Qiita provides a free and open platform for users to:
1) Easily share and reuse existing data-sets in the form of studies.
2) Perform analyses (by combining one or more studies/data-sets) using published and unpublished data that meet the
standards as described by this documentation.
3) Easily interface with the EBI repository for automated deposition. Query and interact with Qiita data programmatically.
