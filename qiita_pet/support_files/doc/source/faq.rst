Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Qiita data disclaimer
---------------------

Qiita is a research tool, and as such, is hosted on research computing resources
maintained by the Knight Lab at the University of California San Diego.

Data privacy is a key aspect of our operations, and is strictly adhered to at
every step of the workflow. We are committed to protecting any and all
information (including sequence data) submitted to Qiita. For example, your data
is sandboxed by default upon upload, and remains private at the discretion of the
Owner (i.e., you are the Owner) of the study.

Authorizations and access associated with any given study is maintained and
controlled by the Owner of the study; importantly, this means that sharing
rights of a study within Qiita is determined solely by the Owner.

Sample IDs, and any associated metadata must be de-identified prior to submission
to Qiita. This is a requirement of our
`Terms of Use <https://qiita.ucsd.edu/iframe/?iframe=qiita-terms>`__.

A study within Qiita, and its associated sequence and metadata, can be
permanently deleted by the Owner as long as it is not public.

What kind of data can I upload to Qiita for processing?
-------------------------------------------------------

Processing in Qiita requires 3 things: raw data, sample and prep information
files. `Here <https://github.com/biocore/qiita/blob/master/README.rst#accepted-raw-files>`__
you can find a list of currently supported raw files files. Note that we are
accepting any kind of target gene (16S, 18S, ITS, whatever). You can also upload
WGS however, WGS processing is not ready.

What's the difference between a sample and a prep information file?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A sample information file describes the samples in a study, including
environmental factors relating to the associated host. The prep information
file has information on how the sample was processed in the wet lab. If you
collected 100 samples for your study, you will need 100 rows in your sample
information file describing each of them, and additional rows for blanks and other
control samples. If you prepared 95 of them for 16S and 50 of them for 18S,
you will need 2 prep information files: one with 95 rows describing the preparation
for 16S, and another one with 50 describing the 18S. For a more complex
example go
`here <#h.eddzjlm5e6l6>`__Â and for examples of these files you can go to
the "Upload instructions"
`here <https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fvamps.mbl.edu%2Fmobe_workshop%2Fwiki%2Findex.php%2FMain_Page&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE4PTOKIvFNlWtHmJyLLy11mfzF8A>`__.

Example study processing workflow
---------------------------------

A few more instructions: for the example above the workflow should be:

#. **Create a new study.**
#. **Add a sample information file.** You can add 1, try to process it and the
   system will let you know if you have errors or missing columns. The
   most common errors are: the sample name column should be named
   sample\_name, duplicated sample names are not permitted. For a full list of
   required fields, visit :doc:`gettingstartedguide/index`.
#. **Add a prep information file to your study for each data type.** The prep
   information file should contain all the samples in the sample information
   file or a subset. If you have more than one FASTQ file set (forward,
   reverse (optional) and barcodes) you will need to add a run_prefix column,
   see :ref:`prepare_information_files`.
   A prep information file and a QIIME compatible mapping file will
   be available for download after the prep information file is added
   successfully.
#. **Upload and link your raw data to each of your prep information files.**
   Depending on your barcoding/sequencing strategy you might need 1 or more
   raw data file sets. If you have 2 raw data sets you may have to rename one
   set so that each set has a different name. If they have the same name they
   will over-write on upload. Note that you can have one FASTQ file set linked
   to more than one prep information file.
#. **Preprocess your files.** For target gene amplicon sequencing, this will demux
   and QC. There are multiple options for preprocessing depending on the
   barcode format and the data output from the sequencing center - this may
   require a series of trial and error to establish the correct option for
   your data files. After demultiplexing a log file is generated with
   statistics about the files demultiplexed including the number of sequences
   assigned per sample.
#. **Process each of your preprocessed data types.** For target gene, this will
   perform closed OTU picking against the latest version of Greengenes and can
   be quite time consuming depending on the number of samples and the depth
   of sequencing.

.. _issues_unzip:

How to solve download or unzip errors?
--------------------------------------

Dealing with large files might be daunting but, in general, following these
instructions should make things easier. First, make sure that you have enough space
for the zip download file; if you are unsure of the size required click on the button
and your browser will show an estimate size of the download.
Second, make sure that your computer has all the sleep settings turned off;
for example, in a Mac, got to System Preferences, Energy Saver, Power Adapter and unselect
the option of "Put hard disks to sleep when possible"; don't forget to save the settings.
Third, download the file but point to the storage that you want to save your file in; using
Chrome, right click on the download button and select "Save Link As ..."; and select the
location where you have enough space (see point 1). Fourth, wait for the download to finish,
this will depend on your Internet service. Finally, unzip the file with a newer version
of zip (see below).

By the way, if you are a developer and would like to add to Qiita the possibility of resumable
downloads, we would happily welcome this contribution.

Now, when trying to open the large downloaded zip file there is a change that you will get
an error like: **"start of central directory not found; zipfile corrupt"**. This issue
arises from using old versions of zip and you need to have unzip >= 6.0.0. To check
you unzip version you can run: `unzip -v`.

To update your unzip for most operating systems you can simply use your regular package
admin program. However, for Mac we suggest using
`this version of unzip <ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/qiita/unzip>`__.

Additionally, there is a chance that you will see an error/warning message like this:
``extracting: BIOM/57457/all.biom bad CRC f6b2a86b (should be 38903659)``. These
messages are consequence of the zip library we are using internally and are fine to
ignore. If you want to check them, we suggest taking any of the files and generating their
CRC32 checksum; in MAC's you can run ``crc32 [filename]`` and should get the first number
in that message; for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ crc32 57457_all.biom
   f6b2a86b

Do you have general analytical questions?
-----------------------------------------

Normally these are: How can I test X factor in my samples? Why do I see this pattern?
Which statistical method better fits my question?

As you can imagine, you are not alone as this is a common problem while doing analysis.
Thus, we suggest posting your question to the `QIIME2 Forum <https://forum.qiime2.org/>`__.
This will generally ensure that your question is answered in a timely manner. There
are many users and developers monitoring the QIIME2 Forum. Posting questions in the forum
allows you to share answers with others, who may have similar questions in the future.

Do you have Meta-Analysis questions?
------------------------------------

A common thing is why do I have a given pattern in my analysis, like
PCoA plots or taxonomy summaries.

Let's start by saying, this is an open area of research so we are still
learning about the effect sizes and what matters in individual and
meta-analysis. However, there are a few good resources to help you
understand those patterns:

1. `Meta-analyses of studies of the human microbiota <https://genome.cshlp.org/content/23/10/1704>`__.

2. `Tiny microbes, enormous impacts: what matters in gut microbiome studies? <https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1086-x>`__.

3. `Qiita: rapid, web-enabled microbiome meta-analysis <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0141-9>`__.

4. Additionally there some posts in the Qiime2 forum that might help you, like
   `this <https://forum.qiime2.org/t/combining-datasets-with-2-sets-of-primers/3073>`__ or
   `this <https://forum.qiime2.org/t/combining-data-from-different-sequencing-centers-and-primers/4241>`__.


How to solve BIOM name errors?
------------------------------

When uploading a BIOM table, you may get an error like: **"The sample ids in the BIOM
table do not match the ones in the prep information. Please, provide the column "run_prefix"
in the prep information to map the existing sample ids to the prep information sample ids."**.
This issue arises if your sample names in your BIOM table do not match with the sample names
in your preparation information file.

To correct this issue, simply add a column to your preparation information file named
"run_prefix". In this column, add the sample names from your BIOM table that matches the sample
names listed in the sample_name column in your preparation information file.

How to convert Qiita files to QIIME2 artifacts?
-----------------------------------------------

Please visit the `Transferring Qiita Artifacts to Qiime2 Tutorial <https://forum.qiime2.org/t/transferring-qiita-artifacts-to-qiime2/4790>`__
in the `QIIME2 forum <https://forum.qiime2.org>`__. Note that all feature table (bioms) and analytical steps will generate qza and qzv, which are QIIME2 artifacts.


How to download raw or all BIOM files from a given study?
---------------------------------------------------------
