Processing recommendations
==========================

Currently, Qiita supports the processing of raw data from:

#. Target gene barcoded sequencing
#. Shotgun sequencing
#. Metatranscriptome sequencing


Note that the selected processing are mainly guided so we can perform meta-analyses, this is combine different studies,
even from different wet lab techniques or sequencing technologies.


Target gene barcoded sequencing
-------------------------------

For this you can start with raw, pre-demultiplexing data or per-sample FASTQ. Either way, you will need to
"Split libraries and QC", which uses the default in QIIME 1.9.1. Once your demultiplexed and QCed artifact is created
you need to select which processing to perform. There are two main ideologies/methodologies to process target
gene data: sequence clustering and sequence deblur.

Sequencing deblur (preferred)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this we use `deblur <https://github.com/biocore/deblur>`_. Here 2 BIOM tables are generated by default: fina.biom and final.only-16s.biom. The former is the full biom table, which can be used with any target gene and wetlab work;
the latter is the trimmed version to those sequences that match Greengenes at 80% similarity, a really basic and naive filtering. Each of those BIOM tables, is accompanied by a FASTA that contains
the representative sequences. The OTU IDs are given by the unique sequence.

Note that deblur needs all sequences to be trimmed at the same length, thus the recommended pipeline is to trim everything at 150bp and the deblur.

Sequencing clustering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we use close reference picking, for an explanation of the different picking methods see
`"Subsampled open-reference clustering creates consistent, comprehensive OTU definitions and scales to billions of sequences" <https://peerj.com/articles/545/>`_.
Here we generate a single BIOM table with the OTUs/per-sample. The OTU IDs are given based on the reference database selected.

Currently, we have the reference databases: Greengenes version 3_8-97, Silva 119 and Unite 7. Depending on your selection is if the reference has a phylogenetic tree.

Shotgun sequencing
------------------

Qiita currently has one shotgun metagenomics data analysis pipeline: `Shogun <https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/6/e00069-18>`_.

The current workflow is as follows:

#. Removal of adapter sequence and quality control: `Atropos <https://github.com/jdidion/atropos/>`_
#. Removal of host contamination using `Bowtie2 <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml>`_
#. Taxonomy profiling using choice of three different aligners and two different reference databases; see sections below

Note that we recommend only uploading sequences that have already been through QC and human sequence removal. However, we
recommend that all sequence files go through adapter and quality control within the system to ensure they are ready for
subsequent analyses. Currently, the command removes adaptor sequences (only KAPA HyperPlus with iTru, which are compatible
with Illumina TruSeq).

Sequences generated with an instrument that relies on two-color chemistry (NextSeq, NovaSeq), need to undergo an additional
quality control step. This step removes trailing G nucleotides which signify that the instrument has finished capturing new
information. Per Illumina's specification, NovaSeq instruments have 3 quality levels (11, 25 and 37), and
high-quality trailing Gs need to be removed. Typically this can be done in conjunction with adapter removal, with Atropos
we recommend using the `--nextseq-trim 30` parameter.

For host removal we currently support *Danio Rerio* (zebrafish), *Drosophila Melanogaster* (fruit fly), *Mus Musculus* (mouse),
*Rattus Norvegicus* (rat), and Enterobacteria phage phiX174 (the Illumina spike-in control).

Note that the Shogun command produces 4 output artifacts:
- The Alignment Profile BIOM artifact, which contains the alignment files
- A Taxonomic Prediction - phylum BIOM artifact, which contains the taxonomic predictions based on the alignment
- A Taxonomic Prediction - genus BIOM artifact, which contains the taxonomic predictions based on the alignment
- A Taxonomic Prediction - species BIOM artifact, which contains the taxonomic predictions based on the alignment
The 3 Taxonomic Prediction files can be used for subsequent analysis and visualization.

Metatranscriptome processing
----------------------------

Sample processing guidelines for metatranscriptomic data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Total community RNA extracted from samples contain both coding and non-coding RNA. Typically, ribosomal RNA make up
>90% of the library if not depleted prior to library construction. Ribosomal depletion allows for mRNA enrichment. Even if
you are dealing with ribosomal RNA subtracted cDNA libraries, there will be some
residual ribosomal RNA in the libraries that you want to remove/separate from the non ribosomal RNA sequences.

Ribosomal read filtering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`SortMeRNA <https://bioinfo.lifl.fr/RNA/sortmerna/>`_
is used for removal of ribosomal reads from quality filtered Metatranscriptome data

Latest SortMeRNA version: v2.1

Input: Quality filtered Metatranscriptome reads (FASTA/FASTQ)
Ribosomal reads are identified by searching against pre-curated rRNA databases. Currently, rRNA databases covering bacteria, archaea and eukarya
were downloaded and indexed from `SILVA <https://www.arb-silva.de>`_ and `Rfam <https://rfam.xfam.org>`_.
Currently indexed databases and their clustering ids:

- silva-bacterial-16s-id 90%
- silva-bacterial-23s-id 98%
- silva-archaeal-16s-id 95%
- silva-archaeal-23s-id 98%
- silva-eukarya-18s-id 95%
- silva-eukarya-28s-id 98%
- rfam-5s-database-id 98%
- rfam-5.8s-database-id 98%

The above databases and ID cut-offs were chosen to work with a range of samples including more diverse/complex environmental samples.

Building Custom databases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Custom databases can also be built in addition to the above mentioned databases.
Custom databases can be built by using the using the `ARB package <https://www.arb-silva.de/download/arb-files/>`_ to extract FASTA files for:

- 16S bacteria, 16S archaea and 18S eukarya using SSURef_NR99_119_SILVA_14_07_14_opt.arb
- 23S bacteria, 23S archaea and 28S eukarya using LSURef_119_SILVA_15_07_14_opt.arb

The built databases will then have to be indexed before running SortMeRNA.
Reference database(s) and their corresponding indexes separated by "," and multiple databases are separated by ":"


SortMeRNA Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SortMeRNA filters the ribosomal from the non-ribosomal reads from the input sample dataset (via BLAST search)and outputs two fasta/q files containing the
ribosomal and non-ribosomal reads respectively.
Additionally, a summary file showing the proportion of reads matching to each of the screened ribosomal databases can also be made available.
Default options have been set to report only the best alignment per read reaching E-value.
For non ribo-depleted samples (i.e. total RNA), the ribosomal reads obtained from SortMeRNA can be further used in taxonomic/compositional analysis.
In the case of ribo-depleted samples, only the non-ribosomal reads are used in downstream analyses such as assembly, mapping, differential gene abundance analyses etc.
