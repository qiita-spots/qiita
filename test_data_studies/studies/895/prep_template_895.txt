Puhimau.mat.1	TCGAGCCGATCT	ANL	Examination of geothermal sites on Kilauea. One site involves a steaming tumulus that supports a stratified biofilm at about 50 C. The site other involves a forest that was destroyed by sub-surface heating.  What exists at present are heated soils and biofilms that develop on steaming tree trunks. The latter include anoxygenic chloroflexi plus a variety of CO oxidizers.	Gasser_Kilauea_geothermal	unknown	"This analysis was done as in Caporaso et al 2011 Genome research. The PCR primers (F515/R806) were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA (both bacteria and archaea), which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length using a procedure similar to that of ref. 15. [For reference, this primer pair amplifies the region 533_786 in the Escherichia coli strain 83972 sequence (greengenes accession no. prokMSA_id:470367).] The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base error-correcting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to 1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions.
